## Design

### Colour Scheme

[Color Palette](assets/images/readme/color-palette.png) 

I chose a colour palette that reflects the professional, warm, and trustworthy nature of the plumbing business, inspired by natural copper and earth tones. 
The palette includes shades of brown and copper for warmth and reliability, complemented by clean whites and deep blacks for contrast and readability.

### Typography

The website uses Arial, sans-serif as the primary font to ensure high readability and simplicity across devices and screen sizes. 
Font sizes and weights have been carefully chosen to create a clear visual hierarchy, with larger, bolder headings to capture attention and smaller, easy-to-read body text. 
This choice supports accessibility and provides a clean, professional appearance fitting for the plumbing business.

### Imagery

**Hero Image:**  
The hero image shows flowing copper pipes with a dark green/gray tiled background.   
The image reflects the plumbing business's core services and matches the site's color palette for a cohesive design.
This image was sourced from [StockCake](https://stockcake.com) and has been optimized for web performance using TinyPNG. 

**About Us Image:**  
The About Us section features a photo of the Nordströms VVS company vehicle, symbolizing the company's local presence and commitment to professional service. 
Images have been optimized using TinyPNG.


**Gallery Images:**  
The gallery features a selection of high-quality images showcasing completed plumbing projects, highlighting craftsmanship and service variety. 
These images were provided by Nordströms VVS i Dalarna AB. 
All images have been optimized using TinyPNG.

## Deployment & Local Development

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This website is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.  
The live version of the site can be accessed at:  
[https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/](https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/)

### How Deployment Was Done

1. Created a new repository on GitHub for the project.  
2. Cloned the repository locally and connected it to Visual Studio Code.  
3. Developed the website files locally using Visual Studio Code.  
4. Committed and pushed changes from Visual Studio Code to the GitHub repository.  
5. In the GitHub repository, navigated to **Settings** > **Pages**.  
6. Set the publishing source to the `main` branch and selected the root folder.  
7. Saved the settings, allowing GitHub Pages to publish the website automatically.  
8. The site is now live and accessible via the GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Deployment Details

- The `main` branch is the production branch; all live updates come from this branch.  
- Any commit pushed to `main` automatically triggers GitHub Pages to redeploy the website.  
- Currently, the website uses the default GitHub Pages URL. A custom domain can be configured in the future via GitHub Pages settings.  
- If GitHub Pages experiences downtime, the site can be run locally by cloning the repository and opening the files in a browser or using a local development server.


### Local Development

  To work on the project locally:  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:  
git clone https://github.com/gooldenapple/vvs-nordstrom.git
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).  
3. Make changes and test by opening the HTML files directly in a web browser or using a local development server extension in your editor.  
4. Commit and push changes to keep your GitHub repository updated.

### What does this mean?

1. **Clone the repo**  
`git clone https://github.com/gooldenapple/vvs-nordstrom.git`  
This command downloads the entire project from GitHub to your computer, giving you a local copy to work on.

2. **Open the project folder in your code editor**  
For example, Visual Studio Code, where you can edit HTML, CSS, and other files.

3. **Make changes and test locally**  
You can open HTML files directly in your browser or use a local development tool (like Live Server in VS Code) to see changes in real time.

4. **Commit and push**  
When you have made changes, you save them ("commit") and send them up to GitHub ("push") so the online version stays updated.

*Screenshot from the W3C CSS Validator showing no errors, confirming CSS compliance.*
</details>
<br>


- **HTML Validation:**  
  All HTML files were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
  - Several errors were found related to invalid file paths containing spaces, e.g., `favicon_io (3)/favicon.ico`. These paths has been renamed to remove spaces for compliance.  
  - Backslashes (`\`) were used in image `srcset` attributes; these must be replaced with forward slashes (`/`) to avoid errors.  
  - Some `<img>` elements had empty `src` attributes or missing `alt` texts, which were corrected to improve accessibility and pass validation.
  - Some end tags were missing or stray, this was fixed by locating the issues and finding the right start tag.

### Lighthouse Testing

- Conducted on both desktop and mobile, scores have improved to a performance range of 90–100.  
- Accessibility scores consistently at 100, reflecting good semantic structure and ARIA usage.  
- SEO scores at 100, indicating good metadata and mobile-friendliness.  
- Best Practices scores around 81–82, with a warning for deprecated APIs and caching policies.  
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) improved but can be optimized further.  
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issues resolved by defining explicit image dimensions and stabilizing hero/navigation elements.

### Known Fixes

- Conducted a thorough review of all HTML and CSS code to identify and fix broken or incorrect code, links and image paths.  
- Corrected file paths by removing spaces and replacing backslashes (\) with forward slashes (/) to comply with web standards.  
- Optimized images with TinyPNG and Squoosh for faster loading times.  
- Corrected FontAwesome usage to avoid legacy JavaScript warnings.  
- Adjusted hero image position and scaling for better presentation.  
- Fixed inconsistent heading hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) to improve accessibility and SEO.  
- Added `alt` attributes to all images for improved accessibility and Lighthouse compliance.  
- Ensured consistent use of semantic HTML5 elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).  
- Fixed layout issues on smaller screen sizes (mobile and tablet) with responsive CSS adjustments.  
- Adjusted Bootstrap grid usage for better alignment and spacing.  
- Corrected color contrast issues to meet WCAG accessibility standards.  
- Removed unused CSS and redundant code for cleaner, more maintainable files.  
- Improved navigation bar responsiveness and spacing on different screen sizes.  
- Fixed missing favicon link to ensure consistent branding in browsers.  
- Corrected `success.html` redirect and form handling consistency.
- Implemented **lazy loading** on images to reduce initial load time and improve performance.  
- Added **preload** for key resources (fonts, hero image) to improve render speed and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). 
- Eliminated **layout shifts (CLS issues)** by defining explicit image dimensions and stabilizing hero and navigation elements. 


## Known Issues and Future Improvements

- **CSS & Performance Optimization:** Some CSS can still be cleaned and fully minified. Critical CSS inlining and further script deferrals are planned.  
- **Responsive Enhancements:** While major layout issues have been fixed, additional fine-tuning may be needed.  
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Current accessibility scores are strong, but future work includes adding ARIA landmarks and expanding keyboard navigation testing.  
- **Image Optimization:** All current images are optimized and lazy loaded, but future improvements may include converting assets fully to next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF).  
- **Caching Policy:** Static assets currently lack optimal cache headers; implementation is planned for further performance gains.  
- **Network Payload Size:** Although reduced, overall page weight could still be improved through additional compression and deferred loading of non-critical resources.  
- **SEO Enhancements:** Planned improvements include adding structured data (schema.org) and further refining meta descriptions for better search visibility.
