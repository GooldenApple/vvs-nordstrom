## Design

### Colour Scheme

[Color Palette](assets/images/readme/color-palette.png) 

I chose a colour palette that reflects the professional, warm, and trustworthy nature of the plumbing business, inspired by natural copper and earth tones. 
The palette includes shades of brown and copper for warmth and reliability, complemented by clean whites and deep blacks for contrast and readability.

### Typography

The website uses Arial, sans-serif as the primary font to ensure high readability and simplicity across devices and screen sizes. 
Font sizes and weights have been carefully chosen to create a clear visual hierarchy, with larger, bolder headings to capture attention and smaller, easy-to-read body text. 
This choice supports accessibility and provides a clean, professional appearance fitting for the plumbing business.

### Imagery

**Hero Image:**  
The hero image shows flowing copper pipes with a dark green/gray tiled background.   
The image reflects the plumbing business's core services and matches the site's color palette for a cohesive design.
This image was sourced from [StockCake](https://stockcake.com) and has been optimized for web performance using TinyPNG. 

**About Us Image:**  
The About Us section features a photo of the Nordströms VVS company vehicle, symbolizing the company's local presence and commitment to professional service. 
Images have been optimized using TinyPNG.


**Gallery Images:**  
The gallery features a selection of high-quality images showcasing completed plumbing projects, highlighting craftsmanship and service variety. 
These images were provided by Nordströms VVS i Dalarna AB. 
All images have been optimized using TinyPNG.

## Deployment & Local Development

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This website is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.  
The live version of the site can be accessed at:  
[https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/](https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/)

### How Deployment Was Done

1. Created a new repository on GitHub for the project.  
2. Cloned the repository locally and connected it to Visual Studio Code.  
3. Developed the website files locally using Visual Studio Code.  
4. Committed and pushed changes from Visual Studio Code to the GitHub repository.  
5. In the GitHub repository, navigated to **Settings** > **Pages**.  
6. Set the publishing source to the `main` branch and selected the root folder.  
7. Saved the settings, allowing GitHub Pages to publish the website automatically.  
8. The site is now live and accessible via the GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Deployment Details

- The `main` branch is the production branch; all live updates come from this branch.  
- Any commit pushed to `main` automatically triggers GitHub Pages to redeploy the website.  
- Currently, the website uses the default GitHub Pages URL. A custom domain can be configured in the future via GitHub Pages settings.  
- If GitHub Pages experiences downtime, the site can be run locally by cloning the repository and opening the files in a browser or using a local development server.


### Local Development

  To work on the project locally:  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:  
git clone https://github.com/gooldenapple/vvs-nordstrom.git
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).  
3. Make changes and test by opening the HTML files directly in a web browser or using a local development server extension in your editor.  
4. Commit and push changes to keep your GitHub repository updated.

### What does this mean?

1. **Clone the repo**  
`git clone https://github.com/gooldenapple/vvs-nordstrom.git`  
This command downloads the entire project from GitHub to your computer, giving you a local copy to work on.

2. **Open the project folder in your code editor**  
For example, Visual Studio Code, where you can edit HTML, CSS, and other files.

3. **Make changes and test locally**  
You can open HTML files directly in your browser or use a local development tool (like Live Server in VS Code) to see changes in real time.

4. **Commit and push**  
When you have made changes, you save them ("commit") and send them up to GitHub ("push") so the online version stays updated.

- Navigate through the menu to explore different sections like Services, Gallery, and Contact.
- Use the contact form to send inquiries; upon submission, you will be redirected to a success page.
- Images in the gallery can be clicked to view in larger format (if implemented).
- The website adjusts layout and content for optimal viewing on various devices.


## Testing

### Manual Testing 

- The website was tested on various devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure responsive design and consistent layout.  
- All navigation links and buttons were checked to confirm they function correctly on every page.  
- The contact form was tested for required field validation, proper error handling, and successful submission flow, including redirection to the success page.  
- The image gallery was tested for proper loading, accessibility (alt text), and responsiveness, including carousel functionality on mobile devices.  
- Images and media files were verified for correct display and optimization to maintain fast load times.  
- Accessibility features were manually tested, including keyboard navigation and focus indicators.

### Browser Testing

The website was tested on multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance and user experience. Testing was conducted on:

- **Google Chrome**  
- **Microsoft Edge**  
- **Mozilla Firefox**  
- **Mobile device**

During these tests, the site performed well across all platforms with one minor issue identified only in Microsoft Edge:  
The contact form section had some alignment problems.  

This was the only significant issue found and will be addressed in future updates.

---


### Automated Testing & Tools

- Used **W3C HTML Validator** to ensure semantic and valid HTML markup.  
- Used **W3C CSS Validator** to check for any CSS syntax errors and maintain styling consistency.  
- Performed accessibility audits using **Lighthouse** and **WebAIM Contrast Checker** to verify compliance with WCAG AA standards for colour contrast and usability.  
- Audited performance and best practices with **Google Lighthouse**, focusing on improving Largest Contentful Paint, image optimization, caching policies, and eliminating legacy JavaScript for modern browsers.  
- Used **Chrome DevTools** for debugging layout issues, checking console errors, and monitoring network performance during development.


### Code Validation

- **HTML Validation:**  
  All HTML files were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
  - Several errors were found related to invalid file paths containing spaces, e.g., `favicon_io (3)/favicon.ico`. These paths should be renamed to remove spaces for compliance.  
  - Backslashes (`\`) were used in image `srcset` attributes; these must be replaced with forward slashes (`/`) to avoid errors.  
  - Some `<img>` elements had empty `src` attributes or missing `alt` texts, which were corrected to improve accessibility and pass validation.

 
![HTML Validation Report](assets/images/readme/vali.index.html.png) 
*Screenshot showing the results from the W3C HTML Validator, indicating validation errors and warnings.*


- **CSS Validation:**  
  The stylesheet passed the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors, confirming compliance with CSS3 standards.

### Known Fixes

- Conducted a thorough review of all HTML and CSS code to identify and fix broken or incorrect code, links and image paths.  
- Corrected file paths by removing spaces and replacing backslashes (`\`) with forward slashes (`/`) to comply with web standards.  
- These fixes directly contributed to improved Lighthouse scores and validation results.  
- Optimized images with TinyPNG and Squoosh for faster loading times.  
- Corrected FontAwesome usage to avoid legacy JavaScript warnings.  
- Improved caching by using file versioning to handle GitHub Pages limitations.  
- Adjusted hero image position and scaling for better presentation.


## Known Issues and Future Improvements

- **Deprecated APIs:** Some heading tags inside semantic containers lack explicit font sizes. Upcoming browser changes may affect layout; explicit sizing is planned.  
- **Render-Blocking Resources:** CSS and JS files block rendering; plans include inlining critical CSS and deferring scripts.  
- **Unused and Unminified CSS:** Some CSS is unused and unminified; planned cleanup and minification.  
- **Image Optimization:** Not all images use next-gen formats or have explicit dimensions, causing load delays and layout shifts; future improvements planned.  
- **Caching Policy:** Static assets lack optimal cache headers; implementation is planned.  
- **Network Payload Size:** Overall page size is still large; further compression and lazy loading planned.  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** Minor layout shifts persist due to dynamic content; reserving space is planned.
