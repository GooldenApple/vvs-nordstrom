## Deployment & Local Development

## Deployment & Local Development

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This website is deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

The live version of the site can be accessed at:  
[https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/](https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/)

### How Deployment Was Done

1. Created a new repository on GitHub for the project.  
2. Cloned the repository locally and connected it to Visual Studio Code.  
3. Developed the website files locally using Visual Studio Code.  
4. Committed and pushed changes from Visual Studio Code to the GitHub repository.  
5. In the GitHub repository, navigated to **Settings** > **Pages**.  
6. Set the publishing source to the `main` branch and selected the root folder.  
7. Saved the settings, allowing GitHub Pages to publish the website automatically.  
8. The site is now live and accessible via the GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Deployment Details

- The `main` branch is the production branch; all live updates come from this branch.  
- Any commit pushed to `main` automatically triggers GitHub Pages to redeploy the website.  
- Currently, the website uses the default GitHub Pages URL. A custom domain can be configured in the future via GitHub Pages settings.  
- If GitHub Pages experiences downtime, the site can be run locally by cloning the repository and opening the files in a browser or using a local development server.

### Versioning & Releases

- Major updates and releases will be tagged in the repository to track changes over time.  
- Release notes will be documented in the repository’s release section.
