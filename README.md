---

## Deployment & Local Development

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This website is hosted using **GitHub Pages**.  
The live site can be accessed at:  
[https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/](https://gooldenapple.github.io/vvs-nordstrom/)  

### Deployment Steps  

1. Created a new repository on GitHub for the project.  
2. Cloned the repository locally and developed the project using **Visual Studio Code**.  
3. Committed and pushed changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.  
4. In the GitHub repository, navigated to **Settings** > **Pages**.  
5. Set the publishing source to the `main` branch and root folder.  
6. Saved settings, allowing GitHub Pages to automatically publish the site.  
7. The live site is available via the provided GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Deployment Details

- The `main` branch serves as the production branch.  
- Any commit pushed to `main` automatically redeploys the site.  
- A custom domain can be added in the future via GitHub Pages settings.  
- If GitHub Pages is unavailable, the project can be run locally.  


### Local Development

To work on the project locally:

1. **Clone the repo**  
`git clone https://github.com/gooldenapple/vvs-nordstrom.git`  
This command downloads the entire project from GitHub to your computer, giving you a local copy to work on.

2. **Open the project folder in your code editor**  
For example, Visual Studio Code, where you can edit HTML, CSS, and other files.

3. **Make changes and test locally**  
You can open HTML files directly in your browser or use a local development tool (like Live Server in VS Code) to see changes in real time.

4. **Commit and push**  
When you have made changes, you save them ("commit") and send them up to GitHub ("push") so the online version stays updated.

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

- **CSS & Performance Optimization:** Some CSS can still be cleaned and fully minified. Critical CSS inlining and further script deferrals are planned.  
- **Responsive Enhancements:** While major layout issues have been fixed, additional fine-tuning may be needed.  
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Current accessibility scores are strong, but future work includes adding ARIA landmarks and expanding keyboard navigation testing.  
- **Image Optimization:** All current images are optimized and lazy loaded, but future improvements may include converting assets fully to next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF).  
- **Caching Policy:** Static assets currently lack optimal cache headers; implementation is planned for further performance gains.  
- **Network Payload Size:** Although reduced, overall page weight could still be improved through additional compression and deferred loading of non-critical resources.  
- **SEO Enhancements:** Planned improvements include adding structured data (schema.org) and further refining meta descriptions for better search visibility.
